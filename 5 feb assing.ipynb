    "Question 2-Name the four pillars of 'OOPs'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: 'Encapsulation' refers to the idea of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data\n",
    "within a single unit. The unit can then be used by other parts of the program as a black box, without\n",
    "needing to know the details of how it works internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: 'Inheritance' is the process by which one 'class' inherits the attributes and methods of another\n",
    "class. The class that is being inherited from is called the superclass or base class, and the class that\n",
    "inherits from it is called the subclass or derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: 'Polymorphism' refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably,\n",
    "even if they have different implementations of the same methods. This allows for more flexibility and\n",
    "extensibility in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: 'Abstraction' is the process of simplifying 'complex' systems by focusing on the essential features\n",
    "and ignoring the details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces, \n",
    "which define the general characteristics of a class or group of classes without specifying their implementation\n",
    "details. Abstraction allows for the creation of more general and reusable code."
